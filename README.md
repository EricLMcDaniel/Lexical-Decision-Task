# Lexical-Decision-Task
Repository for my lexical decision task to see what is primed when people think about the Gaza protests in 2024
The code used here is for jspsych to link to a qualtrics survey

The "index.html" file provides the linkagage between the code and the browser

The "experiment.js" file is the Javascript file that contains the prodecure for the LDT.
The "test.js" file is the file containing the words and nonwords for the LDT. The "index.html" file will load this first before the "experiment.js" file because the "experiment.js" file will have to reference it.
